# Major_Project
College Major Project on Breast Cancer Detection

Primary goal of project is to classify mammography images as cancerous or non-cancerous.

Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hayder17/breast-cancer-detection/data

This dataset contains 3,383 mammogram images focused on breast tumors, annotated in a folder structure. 
The dataset is split into seperate training, validation and testing folders containing 2372, 675 and 336 images respectively.

Note:
The training data is imbalanced containing 1569 healthy cases and 803 cancer cases.

## Installation and Usage

* Clone the repository.  
`git clone https://github.com/subarna-sutradhar/Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Resnet101.git`

* Install requirements using  
`pip install pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Build the model using the Model_Build.ipynb file or the Model_Build.py file.  
`python Model_Build.py`

* To run the UI:  
`python app.py`

* User Interface.
  
  * The landing page is a simple image browse and upload button to enable the user to input the images for prediction.

  * The prediction results are displayed along with the image.
  * A remark column is also provided to obtain information if the prediction is deemed incorrect by the user.
  * The remarks are saved along with the image name in the remarks.txt file.

### Note:
The data analysis and model building process is present in Model_Build.ipynb file.
## Key Features:
* The model is trained using Transfer learning on ResNet50.
* Tensorflow and Keras is used.
* Oversampling is used in the training data to negate the effects of data imbalance.
